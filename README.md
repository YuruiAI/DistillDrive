## News
* **`24 June, 2024`:** We reorganize code for better readability. Code & Models are released.
* **`31 May, 2024`:** We release the SparseDrive paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19620). Code & Models will be released in June, 2024. Please stay tuned!


## Introduction
> SparseDrive is a Sparse-Centric paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving.
- We explore the sparse scene representation for end-to-end autonomous driving and propose a Sparse-Centric paradigm named SparseDrive, which unifies multiple tasks with sparse instance representation.
- We revise the great similarity shared between motion prediction and planning, correspondingly leading to a parallel design for motion planner. We further propose a hierarchical planning selection strategy incorporating a collision-aware rescore module to boost the planning performance.
- On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, SparseDrive surpasses previous SOTA methods in terms of all metrics, especially the safety-critical metric collision rate, while keeping much higher training and inference efficiency.
